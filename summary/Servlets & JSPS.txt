Web Basics:
    Key elements of HTTP Request: means type of operation client is  requesting.
        HTTP Method -> GET, POST, PUT, DELETE ...
        URL -> where we want to get or post information.
        Form Parameters -> data that we submit through a form.
            GET: the form parameters are appended to the URL separated by delemeter (?)
                e.g., www.thrill.io/movie?title=lincoln
            POST: the form parameters aren't appended to the URL, but they are sent separately as part of the HTTP request and that
                separate entity is called a message body or pay load.
                e.g., name=ali&gender=male&...
        Request Headers -> they contain some additional information that helps the server to customize the response.
            User Agent: contains information about what browser the client is using along with the information about the operating
                system.
            Accept: tells what type of content like html/text browser can accept.

    Key elements of HTTP Response:
        HTTP Status Code
            200: OK
            404: Not Found
            500: Internal Server Error
        Content Type
            text/html; charset=UTF-8
            application/pdf
        Content
        Response Headers
            Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
            Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

    Anatomy of URL -> http://www.thrill.io/user/ali/profile.html
        www.thrill.io: (unique domain name (97.137.246.8) is the server name and this name maps to a
            unique IP address in the server.
        /user/ali: is the path which assists the server in locating the resource.
        /profile.html: is the actual resource itself.
        Now this website would be running on a TCP Port(16-bit) which is a 16-bit number that identifies a specific program
            on the server like this website. You can have different services running on a server but on different ports.
            TCP Port(16-bit) - 0 to 65535 ports
                out of which:
                    0 - 1023 (reserved) for well known services
                        such as:
                            21: for FTP
                            23: for Telnet
                            80: for HTTP (default port for HTTP)
                            443: for HTTPS
                    we can specify other than default port for our service and that should be outside the range of 0 - 1023
                        such as 8080 e.g., (http://www.thrill.io:8080/user/...)
